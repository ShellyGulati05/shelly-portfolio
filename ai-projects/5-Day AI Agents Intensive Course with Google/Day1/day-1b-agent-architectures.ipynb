This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

These agents communicate, collaborate, and even negotiate with each other to achieve a common objective, much like a well-coordinated orchestra. This approach unleashes enhanced problem-solving power by breaking down intricate problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, assigning each to a specialized agent. This leads to more efficient processing and significantly speeds up complex computations through parallel operations.\n\nMoreover, MAS builds more intelligent and adaptive software.

Are you ready to build a team for your software?\nEditorAgent > ## Multi-Agent Systems: Your Secret Weapon for Smarter Software\n\nDoes your software often feel like a single, overwhelmed brain trying to juggle too many tasks? Imagine, instead, empowering it with a team of specialized, intelligent \"brains\" working in perfect harmony. Welcome to the exciting world of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)—a revolutionary approach transforming how we build complex and dynamic software.\n\n### What Exactly Are Multi-Agent Systems?\n\nAt its core, a Multi-Agent System is a network of independent software \"agents.\" Each agent possesses its own goals, knowledge base, and specific capabilities. These agents don't work in isolation; they actively communicate, collaborate, and even negotiate with each other to achieve a common objective or solve a multifaceted problem. Think of it like a well-coordinated orchestra: each instrument plays its distinct part, contributing to a beautiful, cohesive symphony, rather than a single soloist attempting to perform every note.\n\n### Unleashing Enhanced Problem-Solving Power\n\nThis collaborative architecture brings significant advantages for tackling complex challenges:\n\n*   **Decomposition and Specialization:** MAS allows us to break down intricate problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each sub-problem can then be assigned to a specialized agent best equipped to handle it, leading to more efficient and focused processing.\n*   **Robustness and Resilience:** In a MAS, the system as a whole is more resilient. If one agent encounters an issue or fails, other agents can adapt, reallocate tasks, and continue working. This inherent fault tolerance ensures the overall system remains reliable.\n*   **Parallel Processing and Speed:** Agents can operate concurrently, processing information and executing tasks in parallel. This capability significantly speeds up complex computations and decision-making processes, which is crucial for time-sensitive applications.\n\n### Building More Intelligent and Adaptive Software\n\nBeyond raw problem-solving power, MAS fosters the development of software that is truly intelligent and adaptive:\n\n*   **Learning and Evolution:** Agents can be designed to learn from their experiences, analyze outcomes, and adapt their behaviors over time. This means your software can continuously improve and evolve without constant manual intervention.\n*   **Dynamic Environments:** MAS excels in situations where the environment is constantly changing. Agents can react intelligently to new information and adapt their strategies in real-time, making them ideal for dynamic and unpredictable scenarios.\n*   **Human-like Interaction:** By modeling agent interactions and decision-making processes, MAS can be designed to interact with users or other systems in more sophisticated, nuanced, and goal-oriented ways, mimicking aspects of human collaboration.\n\n### Practical Applications for Developers\n\nThe practical implications of MAS for software developers are vast and varied:\n\n*   **Complex Simulations:** From modeling intricate traffic flow patterns to simulating financial markets, MAS can create highly accurate and dynamic representations of real-world scenarios.\n*   **Autonomous Systems:** MAS is the backbone of modern autonomous systems, including self-driving cars, sophisticated robotics, and smart grids, where independent decision-making and coordination are paramount.\n*   **Distributed Computing and Optimization:** MAS can be used to optimize resource allocation, task scheduling, and management across multiple machines or networks, leading to more efficient and scalable distributed systems.\n\n### Rethink Your Software Development\n\nEmbracing Multi-Agent Systems isn't just about adopting a new technology; it's about fundamentally rethinking how we approach software development. By leveraging the power of collaboration, specialization, and intelligent adaptation, you can build the next generation of smarter, more resilient, and truly dynamic software solutions.\n\nAre you ready to build a team for your software?\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job!

Running them in sequence would be slow and inefficient, creating a bottleneck where each task waits unnecessarily.\n\n**The Solution: Concurrent Execution**\n\nWhen you have independent tasks, you can run them all at the same time using a `ParallelAgent`.

What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`.

To make it even more vivid, consider adding more sensory details. Is the parchment textured? Does it emit a faint sound or a particular scent? Does the light it emits have a color?\n3.  **Hint at the Map's Origin/Purpose:** While the mystery is part of the appeal, a subtle hint about the map's origin or purpose could further engage the reader. For example, one of the symbols could vaguely resemble something familiar from Elias's maritime experience, or the glowing lines could suggest a celestial path rather than a geographical one, sparking a specific line of thought in Elias.\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the brass lantern, the familiar scent of oil and brine a comfort. For fifty years, this tower, with its steady, life-saving beam, had been his solitary world. Tonight, however, the storm raged with an unusual fury, rattling the very foundations as if the sea itself sought to reclaim its domain. A rogue wave, monstrous and black, crashed against the rocks below, sending a spray of phosphorescent foam high into the air. When the violent deluge receded, leaving the stone slick and glistening, Elias spotted a small, dark object resting on the damp edge.\n\nCuriosity, a rare visitor in his predictable life, warred with the ingrained habit of caution. He descended the winding stairs, his gaze flicking back to the rhythmic sweep of the lighthouse beam, a silent promise to the distant ships. But the object on the rock pulled him forward. It was a rolled parchment, surprisingly smooth, like polished sea-glass, and unnervingly warm to the touch. As he unfurled it, a soft gasp escaped him. Instead of ink, lines of ethereal, sapphire light traced an unknown coastline, dotted with symbols that seemed to writhe with a life of their own. They weren't like any maritime markers he knew; one, a spiral, vaguely echoed the patterns of a distant nebula he'd once glimpsed through a scholar's telescope. The map pulsed with this gentle, internal luminescence, a silent siren call that tugged at the edges of his lifelong duty, beckoning him towards an unfathomable horizon.\nCriticAgent > This revised story is excellent.
